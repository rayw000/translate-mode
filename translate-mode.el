;;; Commentary:
;; A useful minor mode for doing translation jobs.

;; Usage:
;;
;;   Open the translating file you are working with, and run command
;;
;;     (translate-init)
;;
;;   You can also enable `translate-mode' in your working buffer first, and then use command
;;
;;     (translate-open-original-file)
;;
;;   or
;;
;;     (translate-select-original-buffer)
;;
;;   to setup a buffer for referring the original article.
;;
;;   See: https://github.com/rayw000/translate-mode for more details.
